## Description
The vehicle builder is an app that lets you build a custom car, truck, or motorcycle. You can perform cool actions like wheelies (if you build a motorcycle) and towing (if you choose to build a tow truck). You can perform other features like turning, speeding up, and slowing down as well. Once a vehicle is generated, you are able to print all of it's details, such as the year, make, model, top speed, color, vin number and tow capacity (when building a truck).
