  // DONE Create a constructor that accepts the properties of the Motorbike class
    // DONE The constructor should call the constructor of the parent class, Vehicle
    // DONE The constructor should initialize the properties of the Motorbike class
    // DONE The constructor should check if the wheels array has 2 elements and create 2 new default Wheel objects if it does not

  // DONE Implement the wheelie method
    // DONE The method should log the message "Motorbike [make] [model] is doing a wheelie!"

  // DONE Override the printDetails method from the Vehicle class
  // DONE The method should call the printDetails method of the parent class
  // DONE The method should log the details of the Motorbike
